# Go AI Projects with LangChain

Repository for Basic Go AI Projects using LangChain

Welcome to the Go AI Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of basic Go projects focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) tasks using LangChain. Whether you're new to Go or exploring AI development with LangChain, these projects serve as valuable learning resources.

## Project Structure

The repository maintains a consistent structure across all projects for easy navigation and understanding. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in each project directory:

1. **`src`**: This directory contains the Go application code, including modules, packages, and other Go-specific files.

2. **`data`**: Holds any necessary data files, datasets, or resources required for running the AI models.

3. **`tests`**: Contains test files for the project, including unit tests and integration tests if applicable.

4. **`README.md`**: Each project comes with a detailed README file providing information about the project, its purpose, features, and how to run it.

## Getting Started

To dive into a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the corresponding README.md file. These instructions typically include prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the project locally.
